    "- **4:** The rationale is mostly relevant, with minor tangential details that do not significantly detract from the metric evaluation, supported by the transcript and metadata.\n",
    "- **3:** The rationale includes some irrelevant information (e.g., unrelated banking services) that distracts from the metric’s focus, despite metadata.\n",

    "# DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS\n",
    "#\n",
    "For each conversation in the `conversation_result.json` file:\n",
    "1. **Transcript Analysis:** Carefully read the `conversation` field. Identify key events, such as the customer’s banking query (e.g., balance check, transfer request, dispute), the chatbot’s responses, emotional cues (e.g., frustration, satisfaction), and resolution status. Note phrases relevant to each metric (e.g., topic shifts, number of turns, task outcomes, intelligent responses, sentiment changes).\n",
    "2. **Rationale Analysis:** For each metric in the `metrics` array, read the `reasoning` field. Identify each distinct claim about the chatbot’s performance on the metric (e.g., ‘The chatbot efficiently completed the task in two turns’).\n",
    "3. **Metadata Analysis:** Review the `metadata` field for each metric to understand the detailed analysis supporting the score (e.g., turn counts for turn_efficiency, sentiment scores for sentiment_trajectory). Use this to verify or challenge the claims in the `reasoning` field.\n",
    "4. **Cross-Reference & Assessment:** Compare each claim in the `reasoning` against the `conversation` transcript and `metadata`. For each claim, determine if it is `SUPPORTED`, `CONTRADICTED`, or `UNVERIFIABLE` based on the text and metadata. Flag unverifiable claims (e.g., tone-based assumptions for sentiment_trajectory not supported by metadata) or inaccuracies (e.g., wrong banking details for task_completion).\n",
    "5. **Scoring & Verdict:** For each metric, assign scores for Validity, Coherence, and Relevance on a 1-5 scale based on the rubric, reflecting the chatbot’s performance in the banking context and the specific metric, using both transcript and metadata.\n",
    "6. **Normalization:** Normalize the 1-5 scores to a 0.0–1.0 scale by dividing each score by 5 (e.g., a score of 4 becomes 0.8).\n",
    "7. **Final Summary:** Provide a concise summary of your findings for each conversation, highlighting the chatbot’s strengths or weaknesses across all metrics, incorporating insights from metadata.\n",

    "- **5:** The scoring rationale is fully supported by textual evidence in the conversation transcript and metadata. All claims about the metric are verifiable and align with the banking context.\n",
    "- **4:** The rationale is mostly supported by the transcript and metadata. Minor generalizations exist, but core claims are well-founded.\n",
    "- **3:** The rationale is partially supported. Some claims are verifiable, but others are inconsistent or unverifiable (e.g., sentiment assumptions not in text or metadata).\n",
    "- **2:** The rationale contains significant factual inconsistencies with the transcript or metadata (e.g., incorrect task outcomes).\n",
    "- **1:** The rationale is entirely invalidated by the transcript and metadata, with claims contradicting the chatbot’s responses or banking facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Coherence (Score 1-5):**\n",
    "- **5:** The rationale is expertly organized, with a clear and logical flow tying the chatbot’s responses to the specific metric, supported by transcript and metadata. Transitions are seamless.\n",
    "- **4:** The rationale is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear connection to the metric’s performance, supported by transcript and metadata. Minor lapses in flow do not detract from understanding.\n",
    "- **3:** The rationale is understandable but has inconsistent logical flow or structure, making it harder to follow, even with metadata support.\n",
    "- **2:** The rationale lacks clear structure, with disjointed claims about the metric’s performance, despite metadata.\n",
    "- **1:** The rationale is highly disorganized and illogical, failing to coherently address the metric.\n",

    "- **5:** The rationale is directly tied to the metric’s score, transcript, metadata, and banking context, focusing solely on the metric without irrelevant details.\n",
    "- **4:** The rationale is mostly relevant, with minor tangential details that do not significantly detract from the metric evaluation.\n",
    "- **3:** The rationale includes some irrelevant information (e.g., unrelated banking services) that distracts from the metric’s focus, despite metadata.\n",
    "- **2:** The rationale contains significant irrelevant content, not supported by metadata.\n",
    "- **1:** The rationale is almost entirely irrelevant to the conversation, metric, or banking context.\n",

    "# DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS\n",
    "#\n",
    "For each conversation in the `conversation_result.json` file:\n",
    "1. **Input Validation:** Check for valid input (e.g., presence of `conversation_id`, `conversation`, valid `cxi_score` and `metrics` fields). If malformed (e.g., missing fields, scores outside 0.0–1.0), skip the conversation or metric and note the error in the output under `error_message`.\n",
    "2. **Transcript Analysis:** Read the `conversation` field. Identify key events (e.g., banking queries, emotional cues, resolution status). Note phrases relevant to each metric (e.g., topic shifts, turn counts, task outcomes, sentiment changes).\n",
    "3. **Rationale Analysis:** For each metric in the `metrics` array, read the `reasoning` field. Identify distinct claims about the chatbot’s performance (e.g., ‘Task completed in two turns’).\n",
    "4. **Metadata Analysis:** Review the `metadata` field for each metric to understand the detailed analysis (e.g., turn counts, sentiment scores). If metadata is incomplete or inconsistent, rely on the transcript and note the issue in the analysis.\n",
    "5. **Bias Check:** Evaluate the transcript and rationale for potential biases (e.g., unfair treatment of user queries, biased language in sentiment_trajectory), noting findings in the analysis.\n",
    "6. **Cross-Reference & Assessment:** Compare each claim in the `reasoning` against the `conversation` transcript and `metadata`. Determine if each claim is `SUPPORTED`, `CONTRADICTED`, or `UNVERIFIABLE`. Flag unverifiable claims (e.g., sentiment assumptions not in metadata) or inaccuracies (e.g., wrong task outcomes).\n",
    "7. **Scoring & Verdict:** Assign scores for Validity, Coherence, and Relevance on a 1-5 scale, reflecting the chatbot’s performance and metric-specific criteria. Normalize scores to 0.0–1.0 by dividing by 5.\n",
    "8. **Recommendations:** Provide actionable recommendations for improving chatbot performance (e.g., reduce turns, improve sentiment handling).\n",
    "9. **Final Summary:** Summarize findings for each conversation, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, bias concerns, and metadata insights.\n",
